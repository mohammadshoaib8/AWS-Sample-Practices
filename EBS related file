#we can resize volume block but can't file system,we need to resize file system too by below cmd.
$ resize2fs /dev/xvdf 
$ df -h (now we can use the block storage which we increased).
#we can't decrease the block storage size but we can do one thing that is we can create another volume and mount it and transfer the data from first volume.
#we can increase the root volume manually and following the bellow steps. 
$ lsblk (#list the blocks,here we can see the block size increased)
$ df -h (#here we coudn't see the increased size)
$ file -s /dev/xvdf1 (#this cmd checking that which file system it has)
$ resize2fs /dev/xvdf1 (here we get nothing to do,because we resize first partitions for that we use 'growpart'cmd)
$ growpart /dev/xvdf 1 (here we grows partition but not it's file system)
$ df -h
$ resize2fs /dev/xvdf1
$ df -h
