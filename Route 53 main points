Route 53:
    Global Service
    AWS managed Authoritative DNS (customer can update the DNS records and have full control over the DNS)
    Also a Domain Registrar (for registering domain names)
    Only AWS service which provides 100% availability SLA
    Affected by client's DNS caching (not suitable for Blue-Green Deployment if the client caches DNS queries).


Hosted Zone:
    A container for DNS records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains.
    Hosted zone is queried to get the IP address from the hostname.
    
Two types:
    Public Hosted Zone
        resolves public domain names
        can be queried by anyone on the internet
    Private Hosted Zone
        resolves private domain names
        can only be queried from within the VPC.
        
Record Types:
    A - maps a hostname to IPv4
    AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6
    CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname
    The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record.

   
Cannot point to root domains (Zone Apex) Ex: you canâ€™t create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create for something.example.com   
where the record name is the same as the zone's domain name. In the zone for example.com, a record for example.com is said to be at the zone apex.

NS (Name Servers) - controls how traffic is routed for a domain.
Alias - maps a hostname to an AWS resource.

AWS proprietary
Can point to root (zone apex) and non-root domains
Alias Record is of type A or AAAA (IPv4 / IPv6)
Targets can be

    Elastic Load Balancers
    CloudFront Distributions
    API Gateway
    Elastic Beanstalk environments
    S3 Websites
    VPC Interface Endpoints
    Global Accelerator accelerator
    Route 53 record in the same hosted zone.
